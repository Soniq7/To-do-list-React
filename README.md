## Description:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Application is based on multiple React components that are minified and combined to build one page.

This **task list app** is built with HTML, Style-components, JavaScript arrow / generator functions and interactions that are responsible for:

- visual side of all the app components, such as: buttons, input, search task field and task list display depending on whether "task = done" is **true** or **false**.

- interactions, such as: adding new task, task filtering, dowloading sample tasks, marking individual or all tasks as "done", hiding done tasks, removing individual or all tasks from to-do list and subpage routing (tasks and page navigation).


The application uses **localStorage** to store, save and retrieve entered data, when reopened on a given device.

## Available Scripts:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
